In the past few months, Ford has initiated suspension of FordPass accounts
for users who access their vehicle data through unauthorized third party apps
and/or websites.  Some users of this app have reported this problem, although we
    have not been able to confirm it <b><i>was</i></b> the app which caused the suspension
(many of this app's users have also use other third party apps/websites such
as Recurrent).  An
<a href="https://www.macheforum.com/site/threads/psa-unauthorized-api-use-can-disable-your-fordpass-account.13893">
    ongoing discussion of this issues
</a>
is available on the Mach-E forums.
</p>

<p>
When an account is suspended, you need to contact FordPass to have
it reinstated.  They will require you to disable or remove all unauthorized
third party accounts before reinstating your account, and warn you that the
next violation may result in a permanent suspension.

<p>
We have been trying to become an authorized app for a few months and although
this has not happened yet we have made some progress.
In the meantime, if you wish to keep using the app we make these recommendations:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an alternate FordPass e-mail account for this app to use.  Instructions for doing so can be found at
<a href="https://www.ford.com/support/how-tos/fordpass/fordpass-connect/how-do-i-add-another-user-to-my-connected-vehicle">
    https://www.ford.com/support/how-tos/fordpass/fordpass-connect/how-do-i-add-another-user-to-my-connected-vehicle
</a>. </li>
<li>Increase the time between updates.  Version 2022.12.07 has removed the 5 minute
    and 10 minute update intervals; the smallest interval is now 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Avoid using the "remote" app features such as lock/unlock and start/stop.  Do these through the FordPass app instead.</li>
<li>Be sure that forced refresh and automatic forced updates are disabled under Settings.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you want to keep the app but feel uncomfortable using it until we receive authorization, enable
"Hibernate app until public API is released" in Settings.  This will cause the app to stop automatically
refreshing data until the public API is implemented.
Manual refreshes from the three-dot menu will still work.
A notification will appear in the future to let you know all is well.
