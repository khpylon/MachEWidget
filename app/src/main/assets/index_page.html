<h2>Using The App</h2>
<p>All controls are located in the three-dot menu.
    <ul>
    <li>Select "Ford Log-in" to get started.  Your user name and password are <b>not</b> stored.</li>
    <li>Select "Manage Vehicles" to enter the VIN and nickname of your vehicle(s).</li>
    <li>Select "Refresh" to force a query of Ford's servers.</li>
    <li>Select "Choose Linked Apps" to choose which apps can be launched from the widget (located to the right of the
        Settings ("gear") icon</li>
    <li>Select "Set Vehicle Color" if you want to modify the color of the vehicle displayed in the widget.  You will also need
    to set "Enable color display of vehicles" under "Settings".</li>
    <li>Select "Save Settings" or "Restore Settings" to back-up or restore your personal data (useful when the app must be removed prior to a new install)</li>
    <li>Select "Settings" to change various application settings.  You can control among other things:
        <ul>
            <li>set the frequency at which the widget updates</li>
            <li>enable commands for lock/unlock and remote start when pressing the icons (future feature)</li>
            <li>enable the location (if applicable) on the widget</li>
            <li>display charging session information (see below)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Icon Information</h2>
<p>Red is normally used to indicate something unusual happening when you're not using the car.  The hood/frunk, trunk/hatch/tailgate, and doors will be highlighted
    in red to indicate they are not closed.  Similarly, if a window is not fully closed, either a red icon will appear near the corresponding door (full-sized widget) or
    the actual window will appear in red (medium and miniature widgets).</p>
<p>The bell icon <img src="/assets/alarm_green.png" width="18"> indicates the alarm status; green is armed, red is disarmed, and red with a "Z" indicates the vehicle is in deep sleep.
</p>
<p>The ignition icon <img src="/assets/ignition_green.png" width="18"> is green when the vehicle is on, gray when off, and yellow when remote start is active.</p>
<p>The information displayed for the 12V (low-voltage or LV) battery can show voltage, state of charge (SoC), or both.  This is selectable under "Settings".  When shown in a progress bar,
green indicates the SOC is above 80%, yellow above 50%, and red below 50%.</p>

<h2>Accessing Other Features</h2>
<p>
Tapping on various parts of the widget will give access to other features.
<ul>
    <li>A single tap on the alarm icon <img src="/assets/alarm_green.png" width="18"> will display the vehicle's interior temperature.
        This value is apparently only valid when the ignition is on.</li>
    <li>A triple tap on the "Last refresh" text (or for the widget without "Last refresh", triple tap on the vehicle's image on the right) will show information about the last time the app
        updated with widget and the last time information was read from the servers.</li>
    <li>The ignition icon controls remote start/stop and the lock icon controls lock/unlock (remote commands can be enabled under Settings).  Double tap on the
    icon to send the command to the vehicle; it may take up to 30 seconds for the vehicle to respond.  A yellow ignition icon indicates remote start is active.</li>
    <li>The refresh icon on the lower left of the vehicle's image will send a command to the vehicle forcing it to refresh its status (this can be enabled under Settings).
    <b>Warning</b>: Since this has the potential to drain the 12V battery, the app limits how often you can perform a refresh in a 24 hour period.</li>
    <li>Plug-in hybrids only: a single tap on the percentage progress bar will switch between gas and electric information.</li>
    <li>Diesels only: a single tap on the low-voltage battery display will switch between LV battery, DEF level, and DEF range.</li>
    <li>Electric amd plug-in only: a single tap on the plug icon <img src="/assets/plug_green.png" height="18">
        will display the kilowatt-hours remaining in the high-voltage battery.</li>
    <li>A single tap on all other locations will take you to this page.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2>Multiple Vehicles</h2>
<p>If you own more than one vehicle compatible with FordPass, each vehicle's status can be accessed from the widget.  To see the next vehicle:
<ul>
    <li><b>Smaller widgets</b>: double tap on the vehicle image on the right.</li>
    <li><b>Large widget</b>: single tap on your vehicle's image in the upper left corner.</li>
</ul>
You can use "Manage Vehicles" in the three-dot menu to choose which vehicle(s) the app will display.
</p>

<H2>Charging Information (for Plug-in Vehicles)</H2>
<p>The charging status is indicated by icons for the charge plug
<img src="/assets/plug_green.png" width="15">
and the high-voltage battery (HVB)
<img src="/assets/battery_charging.png" width="15">.
A red charge plug and gray battery icon indicate the car is unplugged; a green charge plug indicates the car is plugged in.  When plugged in, the battery
icon will indicate what is happening:
<ul>
    <li>Not charging -- <img src="/assets/battery_red.png" width="15"></li>
    <li>Charge scheduled -- <img src="/assets/battery_blue.png" width="25"></li>
    <li>Charge paused -- <img src="/assets/battery_yellow.png" width="15"></li>
    <li>Charging -- <img src="/assets/battery_charging.png" width="15"></li>
    <li>Charge finished -- <img src="/assets/battery_full.png" width="15"></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Information about AC charging sessions can be displayed on the widget by enabling "Display charge
session info" in "Settings".  When charging, the current power and total energy delivered will be
shown on the charging progress bar.  Information about DC fast charging can be display by
also enabling "Display DCFC info".  Once DC fast charging is detected by the app, it will automatically
request updates from the servers every 30 seconds (note that you mey want to manually refresh
once you initiate charging to have updates start sooner).
</p>
<p>Enabling "Save DCFC logs" in addition to the above settings will allow you to view recent DC fast
charging sessions via "View DCFC Logs" in the three-dot menu.  If you are currently charging, the
data is updated in real-time as information is read from the servers. The logs will show power, energy,
and SOC during each charging session.  Data for each session is stored for 180 days then deleted.
All session data is deleted if this setting is disabled.
</p>
